# Build Circle Superheroes docker tech test

This repository contains a node HTTP API that returns a list of superhero and super-villain characters. 

Our aim is to host this API locally using docker.

## Tips

This tech test is deliberately loose. We're looking for your opinions and ability to be productive without everything being immediately obvious. 

Googling stuff is encouraged if you need it.

Above all, Build Circle values simplicity.

## Tasks

1. Pull the repository and familiarise yourself with it.

2. We want to build and deploy a docker container that hosts the application. Write a script so that we can do this with a single command.

3. Test that the server is running with `curl` command
